## Rules

Rules will be limited to respect creativity.

* Must consent to video and photos throughout the event.
* Must use HTML5 and JavaScript.
* Must upload source code and assets to GitHub at contest close for judges to evaluate. Someone should be able to reproduce your project based on your GitHub repo.

When in doubt, our benevolent dictator judges will make the call. Or break the rules and go for the Jury prize, selected by your peers, instead!
