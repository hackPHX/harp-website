#hackPHX Arduino
is this Saturday 3/2, brought to you by HeatSync Labs hackerspace, live on hackphx.com all day.
50 people will be split into 10 teams for 12 hours to create something awesome from an Arduino, our secret ingredient and the hackerspace's resources. Expect music, robots, interactive light, wearable electronics ... anything.

HeatSync Labs is Phoenix's Premier hackerspace, "Hacking Arizona Since 2009." A 501c3 nonprofit, they're a place to make things with access to tools like laser cutters, 3D printers, CNC mills-- but most importantly the most creative people in the valley. They won New Times Best Geek Hangout in 2012--but don't come hang out. Bring your project and MAKE THINGS.

HackPHX emerged from HeatSync Labs to bring, nay exceed, the amazing hackathons going on in Silicon Valley. Their last event was an HTML5 hackathon but they're not restricting themselves to technology. Stay tuned for costume/prop and lockpicking/security hackathons!
