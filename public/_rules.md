## Rules

Rules will be limited to respect creativity.

* Must consent to video and photos throughout the event.
* Must use our ingredient, the Xadow platform.
* You may purchase additional parts but costs will be limited to keep everyone on a level playing field. All contingent upon judge approval with proof of purchase upon request.
* Must upload source code, hardware designs, BOM, etc to GitHub at contest close for judges to evaluate. Someone should be able to reproduce your project based on your GitHub repo.

Two winners will be crowned. The Judge prize will be chosen by our benevolent dictators in allowance with the rules.  Or, break the rules and go for the Jury prize selected by your peers instead!
